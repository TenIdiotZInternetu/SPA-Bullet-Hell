# Bullet Hell [ABONDONED]

This is one part of the Handheld Console project, a topic we chose for the Students' Professional Activities 2022.

It's a simple pygame project inspired by Touhou Project and similar arcade bullet hell games. It includes the most fundamental systems, projectile movement, unfinished UI, few enemy types etc. We never reached a point of creating a full-fledged stage, even though the laid groundwork is sufficient to do so.
